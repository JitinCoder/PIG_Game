# PIG_Game

Description:-- Pig is a simple dice game .Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

<b>Gameplay</b>
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

1)If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2)If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3)If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
4)The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
